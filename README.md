# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This simple site, built utilising Bootstrap, will highlight all the projects I build over the course over my Front End Bootcamp. Using Bootstrap components and custom CSS the site includes a description of myself and what I expect to learn from the Bootcamp as well as links to other projects I have completed.

## Features

Through the use of tools learnt in class and independent research I have enable several features. The navigation bar along the top of the site links to each section and will take a user there.

Bootstrap cards allow for the easy displaying of my current completed projects and thanks to Bootstraps responsive design I can easily add more as I create them.

Hover effects such as the change in opacity when hovering over a project in widescreen browsers has been enabled using CSS.
